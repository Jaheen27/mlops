# Week 1 – Python, NumPy, and Pandas Practice

This week covers the essential Python programming skills required for AI/ML and MLOps. The focus was on writing clean Python code, working with numerical data using NumPy, and analyzing structured data using Pandas.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Python basics: variables, lists, functions, loops, conditionals
- NumPy: array creation, slicing, broadcasting, operations
- Pandas: DataFrames, filtering, grouping, sorting, basic EDA
